# Wind Turbine Testing  Project Week 1

This project tested different combinations of motors, blades, and capacitors to determine which setup produced the highest voltage output in a wind tunnel.  
All measurements were taken experimentally and visualized using MATLAB.


Our design placed in the **Top 5 out of 40 teams** during the final round of testing.


## Results Overview

Below are the test results comparing various configurations:

| Test | Description | Image |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Blades Test | Voltage vs wind speed for different blade types | ![Blades Test](testingblades.PNG.png) |
| Capacitors Test | Comparison of capacitor values and energy output | ![Capacitors Test](testingcapacitors.PNG.png) |
| Motors Test | Effect of different motors on voltage generation | ![Motors Test](testingmotors.PNG.png) |
| All Configurations | Combined visualization of all tests | ![All Tests](testingeverything.PNG.1.png) |


## Summary

- Collected voltage–wind speed data for multiple turbine setups  
- Used MATLAB for visualization and analysis  
- Observed that voltage increases with wind speed, with small fluctuations due to turbulence and measurement noise  
- Demonstrated sustainability principles through renewable energy optimization
